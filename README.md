# ARM-Challenge
Known issues:
-the horizontal bottles are "floating" when trying to drop them in the bin;
-while trying to place the cube on the scale, when changing the orientation of the end effector the robot becomes unresponsive, knocking down almost all the objects on the table.

The scripts redObj.m, greenObject.m, blueObject.m are meant to run individualy and after each run clearing the workspace is recommended for better results.
